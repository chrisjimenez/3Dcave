        <h3><u>ABOUT</u></h3>

        <p>
          This project uses headtracking to create a 3D experience based on perspective. In other words, the program uses the camera as a way to track the users head and manipulate the scene such that it would look to them as if they were looking inside a room or window. I was inspired by the work of Johnny Lee. But I wanted to do my own playful version of it using THREE.js. Since it's Decemeber, I made a cave room with floating Christmas creepers! You could check out Johnny's video, and other videos, below.

        <h3><u>DEVELOPMENT</u></h3>
        <h4>Scene</h4>

        <p>
          To create the cave room, I only used four planes -- the ceiling of the cave, the walls of the cave(left and right) and the sandy ground. To make the walls and the ceiling look rocky and natural, I used the improved noise function without shading. The shadow effect in the cave were created using THREE.Fog, which increases as we look farther away, which makes it feel like you're actually looking inside a room. The camera is set up such that the user is actually staring at positon [0,0,0] in the scene, and we are at some distance z. So the walls were setup with respect to this. This was perhaps the most difficult part because the planes had to be adjusted such that the edges fit perfectly with the edge of the camera. Otherwise, it'd look weird. You can see this when the headtracking doesnt work properly and the camera moves outside the walls.
        </p> 
        
        <h4>Characters</h4>
        <p>
          The characters were created by using simple geometry objects. I decided to use Minecraft characters, since they were the easiest to draw and less work is needed to render them. The idea was to have most of the characters(actually 75% of them) to be a creature wearing a Christmas outfit. But 25% of the time it would be some random character showing up instead of a creature. There are about 18 other characters besides the Christmas creature. They're all characters from shows that I like, games that I've played, or artists. Oh and I included Nyan Cat because why not. I got all the skins for the characters from <a href="http://www.planetminecraft.com/">planetminecraft.com</a>.
